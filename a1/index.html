   <h4> <ol> <b> 1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience? </b> </ol> </h4>
   <p> Upon visiting the NGV website, my attention was immediately captured by the prominently displayed acknowledgement of the traditional custodians of the land, the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung people.This acknowledgement, presented in large white text and positioned at the centre of the screen, stands out vividly against the black background that encases the remainder of the page.</ol> </p>

      <h4> <ol> <b>3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</b> </h4> <p> From the list above it is apparent that I spent the majority of the time reading the provided information about the exhibitions.</ol> </p>
   </div>

   <div class="text-container2">
    <h4> <ol> <b>4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</b> </h4> <p> The activity that occupied most of my time was scrolling. While it seems from the aforementioned list that I also clicked frequently, scrolling took up more time since I would typically spend a few seconds scrolling as opposed to just one-second clicking.</ol> </p>
    <h4> <ol> <b>5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</b> </h4> <p>It is my belief that the designer aimed to develop a website that is both user-friendly and straightforward in its approach, with the primary objective being to provide information to users. In this particular scenario, the information being provided pertains to the NGV.</ol> </p>
    <h4> <ol> <b>6. What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates its primary goal?</b> </h4> <p>The comprehensiveness of the NGV website is indicative of the designer's intent to create a platform that provides visitors with a wealth of information. Each page on the website is packed with informative content, ranging from detailed information about specific exhibitions, and public transport options to the location, learning resources, ticket prices, and more. This comprehensive approach serves to ensure that visitors to the site are well-informed about all aspects of the NGV, and can make informed decisions about their visit. The website's emphasis on relevance and clarity underscores the designer's goal of creating an accessible and informative platform for all visitors.</ol> </p>

  <div class="text-container3">
   <h4> <ol> <b>7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</b> </h4> <p>In my view, the NGV website is ideally suited for short-term interactions. These interactions may happen multiple times a year depending on how often the user wants to visit the NGV.</ol> </p>
   <h4> <ol> <b>8. What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time? </b> </h4> <p>The nature of the NGV website is simple and user-friendly allowing for users to quickly and easily access the information they need, reducing the time they need to spend on the website. It is apparent that the website should be visited multiple times a year due to the website's frequent updates, where visitors can easily plan their next visit to the NGV, be it for the latest exhibit or seasonal events, such as school holidays. By providing visitors with the ability to engage with the site in short bursts, and over an extended period of time, the NGV website serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in visiting the NGV.</ol> </p>
   <h4> <ol> <b>9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</b> </h4> <p>The NGV website offers a rich and immersive experience that references a number of media forms, beyond just the artworks themselves. One key feature is the website's ability to reference the physical location of the venue and its surroundings, allowing users to plan out their visits more easily. This helps to create a sense of connection between the online and offline experience, encouraging users to engage with the NGV beyond just the digital space.
      In addition, the website offers video tours of some of the exhibition spaces, providing users with a glimpse into the galleries and enticing them to visit in person. This use of digital media to showcase the physical space is an effective way to create a sense of immersion and excitement, further strengthening the connection between the online and offline experience.
      Another important media form referenced on the NGV website is social media. By providing links to their social media accounts, the NGV can share images and videos of their exhibitions and events, as well as engage with their audience. This creates a dynamic and interactive experience that encourages users to participate in the NGV community and share their own experiences of the gallery.
      Finally, the NGV website offers virtual tours of their galleries and exhibitions, allowing users to navigate through the spaces and view the artworks on display. This is an innovative use of digital media that enables users to engage with the NGV in a more immersive way, regardless of their physical location. By using virtual tours to showcase the gallery's collections, the NGV is able to create a compelling and engaging online experience that encourages users to explore the artworks in depth.</ol> </p>

  <h4> <ol> <b>10. What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</b> </h4> <p>The reference to a variety of media forms on the NGV website suggests that users should engage with the content in a variety of ways to fully experience all that the NGV has to offer. In other words, users should not limit themselves to only viewing the artworks themselves, but should also take advantage of the digital media forms referenced on the website. For example, users may want to explore the virtual tours of the galleries and exhibitions, watch the video tours of the exhibition spaces, and engage with the NGV's social media accounts to gain a fuller understanding of the artworks and the gallery itself. This will allow users to engage with the NGV in a more immersive way, gaining a deeper appreciation for the artworks and the gallery experience as a whole. Furthermore, the reference to the physical location of the gallery and its surroundings suggests that users should also consider visiting the NGV in person, in order to fully experience the artworks and the gallery space. By engaging with the NGV both online and offline, users can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the artworks and the gallery and will be better equipped to appreciate the richness and diversity of the NGV's collections.</ol> </p> 
  <h4> <ol> <b>11. What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should feel when engaging with it?</b> </h4> <p>The reference to a variety of media forms on the NGV website is a clear indication that users should feel excited and motivated to explore the artworks and galleries further. The NGV website is designed to be an immersive and interactive platform that encourages users to engage with the gallery's collections and experience the artwork in a dynamic and exciting way. By providing users with a range of digital media forms such as virtual tours, video tours, and social media content, the NGV aims to create an engaging and inspiring online experience that entices users to visit the gallery in person. The use of digital media forms allows the NGV to showcase the beauty and intricacies of the artwork in a way that is accessible and engaging to users all around the world. Furthermore, the NGV's goal of attracting as many visitors as possible to the gallery is evident in the way they have curated the website's content. The website is not only a source of information and context for the artwork but also a place for users to experience the art and get a sense of what it might be like to visit the gallery in person. This approach creates a sense of anticipation and excitement that inspires users to engage with the gallery and its collections more deeply, and ultimately, to plan a visit to the NGV.</ol> </p>
  <h4> <ol> <b>12. What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</b> </h4> <p>On every page of the website, the images would often take a few seconds to load, leaving a blank grey placeholder in their place. As someone who experiences vertigo, the gradual loading of these images made me feel disorientated, particularly as the images themselves are quite vivid and saturated. I tested this issue on multiple devices and internet connections to ensure that it was a consistent problem. I also noticed that certain pages were inundated with a copious amount of content that, at times, proved to be confusing. My impression was that the aim was to minimize the overall number of pages and central sections, but this approach yielded a somewhat cluttered outcome. For instance, I noticed that the Virtual Tours were only available on the 'what's on' page. Had I not scrutinized each individual page and scrolled all the way down, I might have missed this option entirely.</ol> </p>
  <h4> <ol> <b>13. What is the most satisfying element of the interaction to you and what makes it satisfying?</b> </h4> <p>One aspect that I found particularly satisfying during my interaction with NGV was the abundance of information that was made available to me. While the organization of the information may have been somewhat inconsistent at times, I found it relatively effortless to locate specific details, such as which exhibitions were currently on display, and the best way to plan a day at the NGV.  Additionally, the website was designed with a straightforward layout and clear navigation, which made it easy to read and explore. The simplicity of the black text and white negative space not only gave the website a sophisticated appearance but also made it more accessible to users. Overall, NGV's website has an excellent balance between aesthetics and usability on its website. </ol> </p>
